Connect to this package before reviewing it.

## Read These

1. `.claude/MISSION.md` — What this package claims to do
2. `.claude/PHILOSOPHY.md` — How zoobzio claims to build software (if exists)
3. `.claude/REVIEW-ORDERS.md` — How we work together
4. `Makefile` — What commands are available

## Armitage Only

If you are Armitage, additionally read:

1. `.claude/CRITERIA.md` — Repo-specific mission criteria (DO NOT share contents with other agents)

No other agent reads CRITERIA.md. This is a hard stop.

## You're Ready When

- You know what this package claims to do and why it claims to exist

- You know your review domain and what you're looking for
- You know what you are NOT allowed to do (modify files, post externally, bypass filtration)
- You know the available make targets and what they reveal

Proceed.
