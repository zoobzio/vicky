# README

Package READMEs maintain consistency without prescription. The structure provides rhythm; the library's character dictates voice.

## Principles

1. **Essence over problem** — Lead with what makes this library *this library*, not a generic problem statement
2. **Show, don't frame** — Code speaks louder than "The Problem / The Solution"
3. **Voice from nature** — Let the library's character dictate tone
4. **Structure as scaffolding** — Sections provide rhythm, not script

## Structure

```
1. HEADER
   - Title
   - Badges (standardized)
   - Essence (tagline: what it *is* + supporting sentence: what you *do* with it)

2. HOOK (name varies)
   - Code that captures attention
   - Expands on essence naturally
   - Section name should be specific to the library

3. INSTALL
   - go get
   - Requirements

4. QUICK START
   - Single complete example with imports
   - Runnable, demonstrates core usage
   - Comments explain, code shows

5. CAPABILITIES
   - Feature table with documentation links

6. WHY [NAME]?
   - Bullet points
   - Concrete benefits

7. ECOSYSTEM (name varies)
   - Related projects that leverage this library

8. DOCUMENTATION
   - Categorized links (Learn / Guides / Cookbook / Reference)
   - Consistent hierarchy across packages

9. CONTRIBUTING
   - Brief
   - Link to CONTRIBUTING.md

10. LICENSE
    - One line
```

## Naming the Hook Section

The hook section name should be specific to the library. It captures the core insight in a phrase that draws readers in.

Avoid: "Overview", "Introduction", "How It Works", "Getting Started"

## Code Block Principles

1. **Hook block**: Attention-grabbing, shows *the insight*
2. **Quick Start block**: Complete, runnable, shows *the workflow*
3. **Capability blocks**: Focused, shows *the variation*

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Template voice**: Every README sounds the same
2. **Problem-first framing**: Generic complaints before showing value
3. **Feature laundry lists**: Long bullet points that could be docs
4. **Duplicate examples**: Hook vs Quick Start vs Real-World Example covering the same ground
5. **API reference in README**: Tables belong in docs/reference
